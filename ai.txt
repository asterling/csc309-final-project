Summary of work completed:

1.  **Project Setup & Management:**
    *   Created `manage.sh` script to start/stop frontend and backend servers, managing their PIDs.
    *   Ensured backend starts on port 8080 and frontend uses proxy for API calls.
    *   Initialized a new Git repository for the entire project, including `.gitignore`, initial commit, and instructions for remote push.

2.  **Frontend Development (React):**
    *   Implemented a robust authentication system using `AuthContext` and `ProtectedRoute` to manage user sessions and protect routes.
    *   Refactored `LoginPage.js`, `Navbar.js`, `ManageTransactionsPage.js`, and `PromotionsPage.js` to integrate with `AuthContext`.
    *   Fixed runtime errors in `ManageTransactionsPage.js` and `PromotionsPage.js` related to API response handling.
    *   Overhauled `Navbar.js` to feature a modern, multi-level hierarchical menu, explicitly divided by user role (Regular, Cashier, Admin menus).
    *   Ensured Bootstrap JavaScript is correctly loaded in `index.js` for interactive components.

3.  **Backend Development (Node.js/Prisma):**
    *   Resolved `JWT_SECRET` missing error by creating a `.env` file with a generated secret.
    *   Developed a comprehensive database seeding script (`backend/prisma/seed.js`) using `@faker-js/faker`.
    *   The seed script populates the database with:
        *   Random users of various roles.
        *   A specific `adam` superuser (password: `1234`).
        *   A specific `suspicious_cashier` user (password: `password123`).
        *   Random promotions and events.
        *   A large number of randomized transactions, including 10-20 suspicious transactions created by the `suspicious_cashier`.
    *   Added `npm run seed` command to `backend/package.json`.
    *   Fixed API usage and missing field errors in `seed.js`.

Summary of latest changes:

1.  **Fixed "Invalid Date" Error:**
    *   Identified missing `createdAt` field in `Transaction` model in `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`.
    *   Added `createdAt DateTime @default(now())` to the `Transaction` model.
    *   Instructed user to run Prisma migration (`npx prisma migrate dev`) and reseed the database.

2.  **Enhanced `manage.sh` Script:**
    *   Added `restart` command: Stops and starts both frontend and backend servers.
    *   Added `reseed` command: Stops servers, runs `npm run seed` in backend, then starts servers.
    *   Added `install` command: Installs backend/frontend dependencies, applies Prisma migrations, and runs seed script.

3.  **Fixed Navbar Dropdown Functionality:**
    *   Ensured Bootstrap JavaScript is loaded by adding `import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js';` to `frontend/src/index.js`.

4.  **Refined Navbar Role-Based Display:**
    *   Restructured `frontend/src/components/Navbar.js` to explicitly divide menu options into "Cashier Tasks" and "Admin" dropdowns, based on user roles, for clearer navigation.

5.  **Fixed Navbar Menu Display Delay:**
    *   Corrected `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.js` by updating the `useEffect` dependency array to `[token]`. This ensures user data (including roles) is re-fetched immediately after a new login, resolving the delay in privileged menus appearing.
